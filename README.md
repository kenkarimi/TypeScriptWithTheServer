#TypescriptWithExpress

This project shows how you can use Typescript with Node and Express at the backend.

The idea is during development you use nodemon(npm run serer) which will run your typescript's linter/ts-node and then when you're ready you can compile it(npm run build) and deploy your javascript(npm start)
